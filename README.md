# Abstract-Path-GMTK23
Game Jam submission for GMTK 23 - Made in Pygame

Abstract Path's approach to the jams theme "Roles Reversed" was to switch the role of the  player and level. Instead of controlling the player you play as the level in order to complete the game.
This game was my first time working with particles in pygame and my first ever game jam.
